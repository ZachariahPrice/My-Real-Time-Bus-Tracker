# My-Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

**Hello and welcome to my Real Time Bus Tracker.**

The real time bus tracker is a tracker that utilises an api provided by the city of poston and google maps provided by google. What the tracker does is track every public bus in downtown Boston. The buses change to either red or blue depending on what direction they are going. All this information is provided using an API provided by the city of Boston, so the information is quite accurate.

**How to run**

To run the program, you have to download all the files within the folder to your computer. From there, double click the index file and it should automatically work. Warning, do not change the names of any files or the image files. If done correctly, you should see the city of boston on the google maps window and there should be icons of blue and red buses spread across the city.

**Future Updates**

In the future, I do not intend to add any more cities in unless requested, as this was an exercise for my university course.
